I created these images in response to an informal competition run by the 
FOAF community back in 2002! They are all in the public domain. Please 
feel free to use them to indicate your support for FOAF and the 
FOAF project (http://www.foaf-project.org/)

Fork and send me a pull request to update this repository if you want to
add or alter anything here.
